7. Division of Work
Tasks will be assigned based on membersâ€™ strengths and interests, but everyone must work on a mix of tasks.
Work assignments will be discussed and agreed upon during Discord meetings.
If a member is absent, tasks will be redistributed, and updates will be posted in the #task-assignments channel.
8. Absence from Meetings
Absent members are responsible for:
- Reviewing notes in the #meeting-notes channel.
- Acknowledging their tasks and providing updates within 24 hours.
The team will ensure absentees have clear instructions on their next steps.
9. Handling Non-Contributing Members
If a member consistently fails to contribute:
- Discuss the issue with them privately on Discord.
- If no improvement occurs, escalate the issue to the instructor.
- Document all instances and attempts to resolve the issue.
10. Submitting Assignments
Workflow:
- The entire team reviews the deliverables 48 hours before the deadline in the #assignment-review channel.
- The designated submitter (rotating role) uploads the final version.
Backup Plan: Another team member will step in if the submitter is unavailable.
